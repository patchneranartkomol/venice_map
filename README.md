# A IPython Notebook to Analyze LA Active Business Data

As part of the effort to encourage data-journalism and informed activism, the city of Los Angeles partnered with Socrata to share public data on registered local businesses.

This notebook is an attempt to show how the toolkit from the Python stack can be used for a real world data analysis, allowing an LA neighborhood resident to learn more about their community. In this example, we will be building a map of businesses and associated registration and purpose information into a browsable map.
